                <h2>Care Campus Salutes the Release of the WHO iCOPE Tool</h2>
                <h4>7 October 2019 (Geneva)</h4>
                <p>Care Campus today salutes the World Health Organization on the release of its digital application to help health and social workers provide better care for older people.</p>
                <p>Worldwide one billion people will be aged 60 or older by 2020.  By 2050 one in five people will be over 60, more than two billion people. The number of people aged over 80 is projected to triple from 143 million in 2019 to 426 million in 2050.</p>
                <p>While every older person is different, both physical and mental capacity tend to decline with increasing age.  As intrinsic capacity diminishes, older adults need increasing levels of support and care to maintain their independence.  This latest resource, the WHO ICOPE Handbook App, is a welcome addition to the tools that can be used to help older adults age successfully and live their best life.</p>
                <p>As described by the World Health Organization, the WHO ICOPE Handbook App is an interactive digital application that provides practical guidance to address priority conditions including mobility limitations, malnutrition, vision and hearing loss, cognitive decline, depressive symptoms and social care and support.  This App is the first integrated tool that caregivers can use to understand an older adult’s priorities and concerns with respect to their health and wellbeing and then develop integrated care plan to address them by leveraging local resources.</p>
                <p>Care Campus interactive training and educational curriculum is well aligned with the iCOPE framework and is designed with a person-centric prospective to empower caregivers to help older adults to age with dignity.  According to the WHO, the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals will only be achievable if it is inclusive of people of all ages. Empowering older people by safeguarding their health and well-being enables their full participation and social inclusion are good ways to reduce inequalities.</p>
