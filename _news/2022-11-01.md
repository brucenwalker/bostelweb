Bostel Technologies, LLC today announced the issuance by the U.S. Patent
and Trademark Office of Bostel's second patent relating
to the diagnosis of cancer using AI, dual deep learning, and
sonification.

On November 1, 2022, the USPTO issued patent number 11,484,247 B2, titled,
"Phonodermoscopy, a medical device system and method for skin diagnosis". The patent
covers Bostel's new system and method for multimodal deep learning in diagnostic
applications.

"Bostel is committed to pushing the field of skin cancer diagnosis forward. Our novel methods of phonodermoscopy, sonification, and deep learning methods provide life-saving accuracy of diagnosis, with virtually instantaneous service,"
 said Dr. Avi
Dascalu, Bostel's Chief Medical Officer who is a dermatologist and the lead inventor named on both of Bostel's
patents. Dr. Dascalu highlighted Bostel's use of both traditional
vision-based machine-learning approaches, as well as cutting edge
methods that use sonification, or the conversion of data from the image
into structured sound. "We have developed an application that can bring life-saving diagnostics to the world," Dascalu said.

Dr. Bruce N. Walker, President of Bostel Technologies and a world expert
in sonfication, pointed out that reliably detecting cancer when it is
present, and not classifying safe lesions or moles as dangerous, must
both be featured in any effective diagnostic or screening tool.
"Success requires both high sensitivity and a solid specificity.
Bostel's dual deep learning method excels at both these metrics. The patents issued today highlight the novelty and effectiveness of our approach."

The effectiveness of Bostel's now-patented technologies has been well
documented in various peer-reviewed <a

powering products and services that Bostel will soon bring to the
market.

More people are diagnosed with skin cancer each year in the U.S. than
all other cancers combined.  According to the Skin Cancer Foundation,
one in five Americans will develop skin cancer by the age of 70.  If
detected early, the five-year mean survivability rate for melanoma is
99%.  If undetected, or if detected to late, the consequences can be
severe.  Every hour, two people in the U.S. die from skin cancer.
