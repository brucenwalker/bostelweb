Melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer are now among the most common types of cancer, worldwide.  Non-melanoma skin cancer is the 5th most commonly occurring cancer in men and women with over 1 million diagnoses worldwide in 2018, although this is likely to be an underestimate.  Melanoma of the skin is the 19th most commonly occurring cancer in men and women, there were nearly 300,000 new cases in 2018.  

More people are diagnosed with skin cancer each year in the U.S. than all other cancers combined.  According to the Skin Cancer Foundation, one in five Americans will develop skin cancer by the age of 70.  If detected early, the five-year mean survivability rate for melanoma is 99%.  If undetected, or if detected to late, the consequences can be severe.  Every hour, two people in the U.S. die from skin cancer.
