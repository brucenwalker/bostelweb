Bostel Technologies, LLC today announced the publication of its fourth peer-reviewed journal article about skin cancer diagnosis using Bostel's proprietary technology.

Appearing in the <I>Journal of Cancer Research and Clinical Oncology</I>, the article "Non‚Äêmelanoma skin cancer diagnosis: a comparison between dermoscopic and smartphone images by unified visual and sonification deep learning algorithms" discusses recent findings about Bostel's technology used with both dermoscopic and non-dermoscopic images, and for non-melanoma skin cancer.

This follows on Bostel's <a href="/publications">series of publications</a> relating to diagnosis of skin cancer using novel multimodal deep learning.

More people are diagnosed with skin cancer each year in the U.S. than all other cancers combined.  According to the Skin Cancer Foundation, one in five Americans will develop skin cancer by the age of 70.  If detected early, the five-year mean survivability rate for melanoma is 99%.  If undetected, or if detected to late, the consequences can be severe.  Every hour, two people in the U.S. die from skin cancer.
