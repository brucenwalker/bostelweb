                        We are passionate about saving lives, and we know you are too! <br />
                        We started this project with one goal in mind: reduce the deadly impact of skin cancer. We have proudly developed a complete solution whose effectiveness has been demonstrated in a clinical trial and is supported by four peer-reviewed academic papers.
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        You can play a role in the continued success of Bostel's cutting edge skin cancer screening technology.<br />
                    </p>
