Bostel Technologies, LLC today announced the launch of its first <b>crowdfunding campaign</b> on the hugely popular site <b><a target="_new" href="https://wefunder.com/bostel.technologies.llc.2">WeFunder.com</a></b>.

Says Bostel founder and practicing dermatologist Dr. Avi Dascalu, "We started Bostel for one reason: to save lives! And we know that there are millions of everyday people who are as concerned as skin cancer as we are, and want to help." The crowdfunding campaign will enable anyone in the world to consider supporting the efforts of Bostel in diagnosing skin cancer, including both melanoma and non-melanoma cancers.

More people are diagnosed with skin cancer each year in the U.S. than all other cancers combined.  According to the Skin Cancer Foundation, one in five Americans will develop skin cancer by the age of 70.  If detected early, the five-year mean survivability rate for melanoma is 99%.  If undetected, or if detected to late, the consequences can be severe.  Every hour, two people in the U.S. die from skin cancer.

Bostel President, Prof. Bruce N. Walker, emphasized that, "We have proudly developed a complete solution whose effectiveness has been demonstrated in a clinical trial and is supported by four peer-reviewed academic papers. Now, through WeFunder.com, we are excited to make it possible for anyone who cares about diagnosing skin cancer to contribute to this important work."

Following the recent publication of Bostel's <a target="_new" href="https://www.bosteltechnologies.com/non-melanamoma-skin-cancer-diagnosis">fourth peer-reviewed scientific article</a>, which showed once again the effectiveness of the Bostel skin cancer diagnosis system, the company is continuing to advance towards its goal of improving skin cancer diagnosis.
